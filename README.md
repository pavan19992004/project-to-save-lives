# project-to-savelives from earthquakes!!!
my idea behind the management of natural disaster such as an earthquake is to analyse the seismographic intensity of an earthquake and warn people to evacuate their respective houses or buildings and tell them to reach a ground of large space.
   for that my alarms sign boards will be present at the places which are more prone to the threat of earth quakes.
   earthquakes sign boards will get activated as soon as  there is some disturbance in the tectonic plates.
   this may prevent many lives from being lost as there would be a prior warning about the earthquake occuring....
